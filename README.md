# Grid Layout Workshop
Build the design we created in Sketch, the completed design can be found on [Sketch Cloud](https://sketch.cloud/s/vyR0M/a/v09Y2J)

There is nothing to setup, all you need is a modern browser, I recommend using [Firefox Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/channel/desktop/) as we can utilise the Grid Inspector which comes with their dev tools, and a local dev server, a simple one to stup for free is a PHP server, you will more than likely have PHP installed by default on your Macbook. Feel free to use any kind you want.

## Setup a local PHP server on your Macbook
In the root directory of this project open terminal and run the following command: `php -S localhost:8000`

Open up the web address: `localhost:8000` to see the site running in your browser.

## Let's get started
Each step relates to a branch which can be checked out.

### Step 1
